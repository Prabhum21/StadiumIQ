> **⚡ Built for Extreme Scale & Resilience.** Managing a World Cup requires zero downtime. StadiumIQ uses **Google Gemini 2.5** wrapped in an intelligent caching layer with prompt injection sanitization. Powered by **FastAPI** (with strict GZip compression) and **Firebase Firestore** for real-time WebSocket state propagation, it ensures every fan, volunteer, and organizer is always in sync.

## 🎯 The Challenge & Our Solution

A 48-team World Cup across 3 countries creates an unprecedented logistical nightmare. StadiumIQ AI centralizes operations into **one GenAI ecosystem**, serving every audience with 100% alignment to the challenge capabilities.

### 🏆 Chosen Vertical
**Smart Stadiums & Tournament Operations**

### 🧠 Approach and Logic
Our approach is to unify the disparate systems of stadium management into a single, cohesive AI-driven platform. We utilize Google Gemini 2.5 to provide intelligent, context-aware decision support, dynamic crowd routing, and multilingual assistance. The logic centers around real-time data flow: capturing telemetry from the frontend, processing it through an AI layer, and instantly broadcasting actionable insights to stakeholders.

### ⚙️ How the Solution Works
1. **Data Ingestion:** The frontend continuously feeds user context, crowd density, and incident reports.
2. **AI Processing:** Our FastAPI backend sanitizes the inputs and queries Gemini to generate optimal strategies and responses.
3. **Real-time Sync:** The generated insights (e.g., dispatch orders, alternative routes) are broadcasted via Firestore WebSockets to all active clients instantly.
4. **Actionable Outputs:** Fans receive navigation nudges and multilingual help, while staff get actionable triage commands and shift briefings.

### 📝 Assumptions Made
- Stadiums have adequate Wi-Fi or 5G coverage for real-time WebSocket communication.
- Volunteers and staff are equipped with smart devices capable of running the Next.js frontend.
- Organizers have centralized dashboard access to view real-time operations telemetry.
- The underlying crowd density data is simulated but accurately reflects high-density patterns.

## ✨ Feature Showcase (Alignment with Challenge Tracks)

We built StadiumIQ to perfectly map 1-to-1 against the four required capabilities for the **Smart Stadiums & Tournament Operations** track. You can verify this mapping programmatically via our dedicated `GET /api/capabilities` endpoint.

| Capability Track | Feature Implementation | Endpoint |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| 👥 **Dynamic Crowd Management** | Live Firestore density telemetry synced to organizers' dashboards for real-time queue distribution. | `GET /api/crowd` |
| 🧭 **Smart Indoor Navigation** | Accessibility-aware interactive Leaflet map routing fans safely around high-density zones. | `POST /api/decision` |
| ⚡ **Real-Time Decision Support** | Gemini-powered incident triage forecasting explicit `risk_trajectory` trends to dispatch the right volunteers instantly. | `POST /api/decision` |
| 🗣️ **Multi-Language Assistance Modules** | Dedicated translation and localization engine answering fan queries and generating PA announcements in any language. | `POST /api/multilingual-assist` |

In addition to the core 4 tracks, we also support:
| Additional Feature | Description | Endpoint |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| 🌱 **Sustainability & Transport** | Travel carbon-footprint calculation and green travel nudges. | `POST /api/sustainability` |
| 🦺 **Volunteer Enablement** | Role-specific shift briefings (duties, escalation paths). | `POST /api/briefing` |
| 📢 **Operational Intelligence** | Automated PA announcement translation. | `POST /api/announce` |
| 🗓️ **Match-Day Planning** | AI-crafted personalized itineraries based on fan context. | `POST /api/chat` |
| ♿ **Accessibility** | **WCAG 2.1 AA** compliant dashboard with `aria-live` and step-free routing. | *cross-cutting* |

## 🏗️ Architecture & AI Workflow

```mermaid
flowchart TD
    Users["Fans / Volunteers"] --> NextJS["Next.js App Router"]
    NextJS <--> Firestore[("Firestore Real-time WebSockets")]
    NextJS --> FastAPI["FastAPI Backend (GZip + Rate Limited)"]
    FastAPI --> Sanitizer["Prompt Injection Sanitizer"]
    Sanitizer --> Gemini["Google Gemini 2.5"]
    Gemini --> JSON["Structured JSON Cache"]
    JSON --> FastAPI
    FastAPI --> NextJS
```

Data flows automatically: 
1. **Frontend** captures user context.
2. **FastAPI** strips malicious payloads and queries **Gemini**.
3. **Gemini** natively generates deterministic JSON strategies leveraging strict `response_schema` validation.
4. **Firestore** broadcasts changes to all clients instantly.

---

## 🛡️ Uncompromising Security & Efficiency

We treat security and scale as first-class citizens:
- **Eager Environment Validation:** A FastAPI `lifespan` event asserts the presence of required AI keys immediately on server startup to fail-fast rather than failing lazily in production.
- **Prompt Injection Defense:** A custom Regex sanitizer (`backend/utils/sanitize.py`) actively strips control characters and neutralizes "jailbreak" attempts (e.g., *ignore previous instructions*) before they reach Gemini.
- **GZip Compression:** FastAPI is equipped with `GZipMiddleware` to aggressively compress payloads, saving bandwidth on stadium Wi-Fi.
- **AI Caching Layer:** Identical prompts within a 60-second window are served from an async memory cache, preventing API rate limits and saving costs.
- **Security Headers:** Strict CORS, X-XSS-Protection, and Helmet-equivalent middleware.

---

## 🧪 Testing & Verification

StadiumIQ includes a robust, native `pytest` suite ensuring absolute reliability:
- **Google GenAI Client Mocking:** Tests natively mock `client.aio.models.generate_content` to execute the actual exponential backoff retry loop within the `GeminiService`, validating resilience against simulated API outages.
- **Strict Structural Typing:** Frontend TypeScript definitions identically match Backend Pydantic models to ensure complete parity across the stack without runtime parsing errors.

---

## ♿ Accessibility (WCAG 2.1 AA)

StadiumIQ is built for *everyone*:
- **Aria Live Regions:** Dynamic dashboard widgets (Crowd Summaries, Incident Alerts) use `aria-live="polite"` and `aria-live="assertive"` to naturally announce critical stadium changes to screen readers.
- **Semantic HTML & Contrast:** High contrast glassmorphism, explicit `aria-label` attributes on all inputs, and keyboard-navigable components.
- **Step-Free Routing:** The decision engine explicitly factors in mobility profiles to provide stair-free routes.
